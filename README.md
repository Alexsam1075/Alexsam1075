# Hey there, I'm Sasha Samanykin! 🚀

**Welcome to my digital playground!**  
I'm a 16-year-old IT enthusiast from Moscow, diving into the world of tech since I was 12. From crafting games in **Unity** and **Roblox Studio** to designing sleek UI in **Figma**, I love exploring every corner of the digital universe. 🎮✨

### What I Do
- 🕹️ **Game Development**: Building immersive worlds and mechanics in Unity and Roblox Studio.  
- 🎨 **Design & Animation**: Creating stunning visuals in Krita and smooth edits in CapCut.  
- 🎵 **Music Production**: Composing beats and experimenting with sound in FL Studio.  
- 💻 **Coding**: From Telegram bots to custom music players with Yandex Music-inspired designs.  
- 🌐 **Social Media & Content**: Running channels from TikTok to YouTube, sharing my Minecraft adventures and more!  

### My Journey
Started coding after a 100km hike in Moscow (yep, with a sore throat! 😅). Since then, I've been hooked, winning **1st place** at school project fairs for 3 years straight with projects like a customizable music player and an electronic diary prototype. I even pitched at a university contest, selling my ideas to the judges! 🏆  

Currently, I'm hyped to join an **IT-focused class** in high school, where I'll keep pushing my skills. Right now, I'm working on a **Telegram bot** to connect my future classmates — stay tuned! 😎

### Fun Facts
- 🔍 Hacked my school's digital diary (just a clever workaround, don't worry!).  
- 📝 Wrote project documentation in 9th grade — not your average teen hobby!  
- 🎯 Dream big: Been aiming for an IT class since 5th grade, and now I'm almost there!  

### What's Next?
I'm always tinkering with new ideas, whether it's a game, an app, or a creative project. Check out my repos to see what I'm building, and feel free to reach out if you want to collab or just chat about tech! 🚧
